          I'm a programmer from Thane, Maharashtra. I like chess, computers and
          stories.

          This will be my place to share my weekly coding adventures and some
          cool things I encounter. Mostly documenting for future "me" to
          reminisce how I was messing around. I have an important year coming up{" "}
          <em>(graduating next year)</em>, so would like this to be a medium to
          keep track of everything that'll get overwhelming.

          I appreciate details yet they are often what we forget over time. My
          writings are certainly not going to be the best, but you start
          somewhere.
