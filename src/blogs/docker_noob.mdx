# I'm a Docker noob

## What is Docker?
Docker _(from my understanding)_ is a containerization tool that helps to solve the "it works on my machine" 
problem when you can't seem to get a project working on your system that works properly on your colleague's. Projects
involve a lot of setting-up, installations maybe even running some scripts. Docker saves you by automating this "set-up" process.
<br />
It creates a container which is essentially a process, that contains its own OS (yes an operating system), a folder containing your project 
and runs commands to setup your project. These containers are saved in the form of images (I think of it as class : object :: image : container).
The image can then be used to spin up a container on any machine with docker installed, saving you all the hassle.

## Installing Docker 
Issues started with installation itself. I had very recently updated to [mint 22](https://www.linuxmint.com/edition.php?id=316) 
which is based on ubuntu 24.04. Docker didn't have an official installation guide for the latest version. 
I had to download and install 5 individual dpkg packages from the [downloads' index](https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/) which looks scary idk.
<br />
Docker was installed, but I still couldn't run commands without "sudo" which I realized was happening 
because there were not 5 but 6 packages (literally called the "docker-ce-rootless-extras") that had to be installed. 
Finally I had docker running on my system.

## Connecting to local postgres from docker container 
To learn the basics of docker I referred to [this University of Helsinki course](https://devopswithdocker.com).
I only completed the [first tutorial](https://devopswithdocker.com/part-1/section-1) which was enough to get started.
I decided on [a simple golang todo webserver](https://github.com/craniacshencil/got-to-do) as my first project to dockerize.
It involved connecting to postgres but my tcp connections were getting refused. 
```sh
dial tcp [::1]:5432: connect: connection refused
```
Turns out my docker container could not connect to postgres.

## Not understanding how docker and localhost interact
This problem stemmed out of "localhost". Yes, quite literally. Well docker containers are not simply processes.
They are more or less like "imaginary machines" that have their own IP addresses. 
So whenver I was using "localhost" in my connection strings, it did not refer to my machine, it referred to the docker container itself where postgres wasn't installed.

<br />
Postgres (for security purposes) 
is configured to only listen to localhost i.e
only accept network connections from ports that are on the same machine. This had a pretty easy fix. 
You have to allow those IP addresses to connect to postgres but how do you find those IPs?

```sh
docker network ls
```

```
Output:
NETWORK ID     NAME                 DRIVER    SCOPE
9d51ac16faf0   host                 host      local
57299c826d07   bridge               bridge    local
48ea99912806   medal-poll_default   bridge    local
661d78962012   none                 null      local
```

Here the bridges are network interfaces, think of them as "exits". All the docker containers that wish to communicate with any service on localhost, in our case postgres will route their messages through these bridges. They are "bridges" that allow data transfer from the docker container to your machine. 

Now we know 2 bridges i.e network interfaces exist, lets find their IP addresses

```sh
ifconfig
```

```sh
Output:
br-48ea99912806: flags=4099<UP,BROADCAST,MULTICAST>  mtu 1500
        inet 172.18.0.1  netmask 255.255.0.0  broadcast 172.18.255.255
...
docker0: flags=4099<UP,BROADCAST,MULTICAST>  mtu 1500
        inet 172.17.0.1  netmask 255.255.0.0  broadcast 172.17.255.255
...
```

You can also see how the "bridges" connect the containers and our localhost 
```sh
ip route 
```
```sh
Output:
...
172.17.0.0/16 dev docker0 proto kernel scope link src 172.17.0.1 linkdown 
172.18.0.0/16 dev br-48ea99912806 proto kernel scope link src 172.18.0.1 linkdown 
...
```
The output suggests that the containers are spun up on networks 172.17.x.x and 172.18.x.x (on my machine, can be different on yours).
And all the data from this container is then sent to the bridges at 172.17.0.1 and 172.18.0.1 respectively from where our localhost can access it. 

<br/>
Lets run some docker containers (you can run base images of ubuntu or some other common images), and see their IP addresses.
```sh
docker inspect \
-f '{{range.NetworkSettings.Network}}{{.IPAddress}}{{end}}'
<docker_container_id>
```
Some of the outputs that I got were 172.17.0.3, 172.18.0.2, 172.17.0.2. Which confirms that our docker containers are running on the networks that we have been tracking.


## Accepting connections from docker containers 
Now we know the IP addresses of our docker containers and also our bridges, You can now configure postgres to listen to them.

In (for me postgres 16) /etc/postgresql/16/postgres.conf
```sh
listen_addresses = "*"
```

At first glance this might seem like a security concern but there's more levels of security involved that lead to filtering of 
unauthorized connections.

In /etc/postgresql/16/pg_hba.conf
```sh
host    all             all             172.18.0.0/16             scram-sha-256
host    all             all             172.17.0.0/16             scram-sha-256
```

## Allowing TCP connections using ufw
Even after doing all these steps, I got the same error. 
```sh
dial tcp [::1]:5432: connect: connection refused
```
With postgres configured to listen to my docker bridges, there was still one part missing. The firewall, its another layer of security that prevents connections "from outside" to interact with ports on your machine.
Now postgres usually runs on port 5432 (check your postgresql.conf file) and it runs exclusively on tcp connections.
So we just need to allow tcp connections on port 5432 from the networks that our containers spin up on, which we've found out previously.

```sh
sudo ufw allow proto tcp from 172.17.0.0/16 to any port 5432
sudo ufw allow proto tcp from 172.18.0.0/16 to any port 5432
```

To check if the additions were successful
```sh
sudo ufw status
```

```sh
Status: active

To                         Action      From
--                         ------      ----
5432/tcp                   ALLOW       172.18.0.0/16             
5432/tcp                   ALLOW       172.17.0.0/16
```

## Changes in connection strings
The final step is to replace "localhost" with "host.docker.internal" in your connection strings and .env files. 
This is because "localhost" from within the container refers to its ow n ip address whereas "host.docker.internal" refers to the machine on which docker is running i.e your system.
I have usually found it easier to just make 2 .env files, .env.local and .env.docker. 
One for local development and the latter for the docker container.
<br/>
For host.docker.internal to be recognized however you have to add an extra flag in your command when you spin up your container.
```sh
docker run -dp 127.0.0.1:<port>:<port> --add-host=host.docker.internal:host-gateway <image>:<tag> 
```
<br/>
Now the docker containers should be functioning as intended. If they don't you need to reboot, postgresql and ufw are system services which probably need a restart (not the services, your system) to apply new rules.

<br/>
Restarting the services gave me false hope. Postgres would get connected, but on reboot it wont' work and give me the same tcp connection refused error

<br/>
Hope you learned something from my docker-postgres saga!
